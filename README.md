# Sublime text custom config

Somewhere to keep a record of my Sublime Text preferences and list the packages I install.


## Packages

These are all installed via Package Control unless otherwise stated. If you don't already have it [Package Control itself should be installed](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) before going any further.
